## General
- // is for floor
- for i in range(start,end): COLON VERY IMPORTANT
- return 'T'rue

## Arrays
- array [-1] returns the element of last position in array
- arr = [0] * 5 creats array of size five with contents 0
- arr = [0 for x in range(10)] creates [0,0,0,0...]
- arr.sort() VS arr.sort(reverse=True)
- list1.sort(key=sortSecond)  for tuple array sort (better in swift)



```python
