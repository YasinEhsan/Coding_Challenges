Notes for technical interview prep.

## Pattern Recognize, code, optimize
- Sliding window : contiguous subarray, substring
- Two pointers : triplet sums
- Tree BFS : level-oriented maths, horizontal relations
- Tree DFS :


## Some Ways of Preparing
- Strategy 1 (Mastery) : One topic at a time. i.e. To get good with linked lists, tackle all linked list related Qs
- Strategy 2 (Exposure) : Devise a method for the problem, then compare solutions. Code problem when unfamiliar
- Strategy 3 (Motivate) : Knockout as many doable problems to get the ball rolling. Consistency is ðŸ”‘
- Strategy 4 (Specific) : Interviewing soon. ROTE memorize recent questions. Find patterns.
- Strategy 5 (PEMDAS): Find balance between frequently asked questions at companies applied to and problem sets on topics less familiar. In my case, its graphs and DP.
