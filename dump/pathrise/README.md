### Serialize-deserialize-bt
- **Problem** Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
- **Clarifying Qs.** full complete ? values ascii utf?
- **Complexity** O(n)/O(n)

  + [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/)

### 3sum1
- **Problem** Determine if any 3 integers in an array sum to 0.
- **Clarifying Qs.** overflow? space time restrictions?
- **Complexity** O(n^2)/O(1)
  - [View Code](3sum1.java)
  - [Dope Explanation](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/discuss/304552/O(n2)-time-O(1)-space-solution)

### Total-contiguous-subarray
- **Problem** Given an array of integers and an integer k, you need to find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to k.
- **Clarifying Qs.** zero? pos neg? overflow?
- **Complexity** n for both
  - [Go to Code](total-contiguous-subarray.java)
  - [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/)

### Contiguous-subarray2
- **Problem** Given an array of unsorted integers and a integer target, return true if a contiguous subarray sums up to the integer target. Otherwise, return false
- **Clarifying Qs.** pos negative?
- **Complexity** n for both
  - [Go to Code](contiguous-subarray2.java)
  - [Youtube Vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJDlxZNe1UI)

### Contiguous-subarray1
- **Problem** Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.
- **Ask 3 Qs.** is there 0? is there negative #? account for overflow?
- **Complexity** time, space: O(n), O(1)
  + [Go to Code](contiguous-subarray1.java)
  + [Youtube Vid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MmGzdiKR9Y)
  - [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)




### Wildcard-lookup
 - **Problem** There are two parts to this question. The first is a function called setup that takes a list of words. In this function, you have a chance to preprocess the list of words in order to solve and improve the runtime of the second part which is a function called isMember. isMember takes in a string and returns whether or not that string exists in the list of words. isMember may also contain one or more dots (.) which is a wildcard that matches exactly one character of any value in setup at the current index of the string.
- **Clarifying Qs.** ascii or utf? upprcase / lowercase? isSetup called once?
